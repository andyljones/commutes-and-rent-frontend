Written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), it interprets the files turned out by the [preprocessor](https://github.com/andyljones/commutes-and-rent-preprocessor) into a [Leaflet](leafletjs.com) map of the tube stations in London and a [D3](D3js.org) chart of the commute times to any station versus the rent statistics at the various origins.
